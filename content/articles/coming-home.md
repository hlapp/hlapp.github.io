Do you know this feeling of coming home to this place where you have
grown up, or where you've spent a significant part of your life? This
feeling of anxious anticipation about finding all the things again
that you still remember? The being filled with excitement about
knowing how to get around, knowing where and how to go for what, about
fitting right in and hitting the ground running because you've been
there, done that, even if some time ago? This excitement of coming
home, only to find looking around once you exit the train (or bus)
that you don't recognize anything, that everything has changed,
that nothing is like it used to be.

I have started a new role as the Director of Informatics at the Center
for Genomic and Computational Biology (GCB) at Duke. The center is coming
to life on July 1, 2014, and is one of the successors of Duke's
Institute for Genome Sciences and Policies (IGSP). I worked in
(functional) genomics for nearly a decade before joining NESCent
in 2006, and was fortunate to be witness to (and having to deal with
the data management fallout) of pioneering whole-genome oriented data
generation and research. Hence, in some ways I feel like I'm coming
home, professionally speaking.

Except that genomics has changed enormously since when I was last at
its forefront. Next-generation sequencing technologies were just
beginning to emerge, core facilities weren't popular yet, nor did they
offer metagenomics and transcriptomics as commodity services, and
1TB was still considered massive. That a full genome sequence database
could uncompress to more than 4GB was annoying rather than normal.

The GCB starts with several core facilities at the cutting edge of
sequencing, proteomics, expression profiling, and computational
analytics, each of which generates, distributes, and crunches through
massive amounts of data. And massive now means orders of magnitude
more than back then. Researchers at the center may need 100TB fast
storage on a HPC cluster the next day.
