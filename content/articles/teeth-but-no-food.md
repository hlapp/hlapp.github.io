Title: NSF lending teeth, but no food to data sharing?

Instead of the typically vague and generically statements found in past NSF program solicitations, recent ones have become increasingly specific. For example, the [2014 Dimensions of Biodiversity solicitation](http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14525/nsf14525.htm) states right at the top in no unequivocal terms:

    > Projects funded by the Dimensions of Biodiversity Program are now required to format and deposit phylogenetic character matrices and trees within the Open Tree of Life Project. 

    The just released [Genealogy of Life solicitation](http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14527/nsf14527.htm) states:

    > As conditions of funding: 1) any image and/or digitized data of physical specimens must be made available through \[iDigBio\], and 2) all genealogies and underlying data sets must be included within the Open Tree of Life (see <http://purl.org/opentree/data-sharing> for instructions). For both of these types of data the PI is expected to format all data appropriately and meet the standards set by these two resources so that data can be immediately made accessible through these two resources.

    Never mind that Open Tree is not a data archive, and is only funded for 3 years.
